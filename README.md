Hello everyone! I am Ronnie, a beginner in code, I am AUTTP.
Please use these files wisely, as there is some malware. If you install it, I am not at fault for your computer frying.
I also make other things, so check that out too!
By the way, the main.py thing is malware.
----ATTENTION!----
How to remove my malware:
OPEN THE ZIP FILE.
DELETE MAIN.PY
IT WILL START AUTOMATICALLY AFTER INSTALLATION.
YOU DO NOT NEED TO UNZIP OR RUN IT, IT WILL FRY YOUR COMPUTER EVEN THOUGH ITS ZIPPED
THE FILE WILL NEED 1 MINUTE OR LESS TO START. IN THAT TIME, DELETE IT.
